# Seattle vacation rentals market

## Contents

## 1. Project overview

Using data scraped by kaggle, This notebook will explore data from the Seattle housing market, and togather with Pandas and other libraries try to answer business questions regarding Seattle's vacation market:

How does the average price change across the year? <br>
Does that mean that itâ€™s also the hardest time to get a reservation? <br>
Another interesting metric is, how do the consumers choose to rate their property? <br>
How do price and score affect each other?

## 2 .Libraries used:

import pandas as pd <br>

## 5 Conclusions:
I think AirBnB's data is really interesting, it can support conclusions we already expect and help us find new ons. It was a pleaser to share the <br>
insights I found, I did expect to see summertime more expensive but didnt to find that cleanliness is so important!

This is the post I wrote about my conclusions: <br>
